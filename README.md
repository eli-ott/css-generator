# css-generator

Generate CSS3 code whithout coding, but only with range and text input.
You can create button design by changing some options like the color the border etc. You can also create the button hover animation whithout coding.

This project was created with jquery because it was easier to select the nice inputs and to get their values. It saves me a lot of time and working with jQuery is very simple, much more than react or angular. I didn't use react because the site is composed of only 3 to 5 pages so it doesn't need to be done in React. Further more there is no special animation the main objective of this site is only creating the CSS code not to have the most incredible design.

The purpose of this site is not the design but more the concept of changing the button style depending on the inputs and to create a CSS code only with javascript. The design could be a lot better but i really wanted to learn how to create CSS code with javascript so excuse me for se design ;)
